# Kuwahara Filter

Implementation of the Kuwahara filter in Unity, for the built-in renderer.
Includes a basic Kuwahara filter and a generalized Kuwahara filter.

The Kuwahara filter was originally developed to denoise medical images, but due
to the paint brush-like artifacts it creates, it is now primarily used for
artistic effect.

This project is heavily inspired by the YouTube video
["This is the Kuwahara Filter"](https://youtu.be/LDhN-JK3U9g?si=nhlqjrNwqO8pPd5x)
by Acerola.

### *Anisotropic Kuwahara Filtering with Polynomial Weighting Functions*

Code for the generalized Kuwahara filter is based on the white paper
"Anisotropic Kuwahara Filtering with Polynomial Weighting Functions" by Jan Eric
Kyprianidis, Amir Semmo, Henry Kang, Jürgen Döllner. A copy of this white paper
has been included in this project at [Research/kang-tpcg2010.pdf].
